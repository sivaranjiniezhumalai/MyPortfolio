        "I worked on generating and running the WRF model to simulate atmospheric conditions for specific regions. I retrieved and analyzed key meteorological variables (temperature, wind, humidity, etc.) from model outputs based on assigned dates, times, and coordinates. I extracted data from NetCDF files using Python tools and processed it for use in climate analysis and forecasting. This role deepened my understanding of numerical weather prediction and geospatial data handling. I also gained hands-on experience with high-performance computing and scientific data workflows.",
